/**
 * <p>
 *     Any Reporting Task that implements this interface will be provided the opportunity to verify
 *     a given configuration of the Reporting Task. This allows the Reporting Task to provide meaningful feedback
 *     to users when configuring the dataflow.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Generally speaking, verification differs from validation in that validation is expected to be very
 *     quick and run often. If a Reporting Task is not valid, it cannot be started. However, verification may be
 *     more expensive or time-consuming to complete. For example, validation may ensure that a username is
 *     provided for connecting to an external service but should not perform any sort of network connection
 *     in order to verify that the username is accurate. Verification, on the other hand, may create resources
 *     such as network connections, may be more expensive to complete, and may be run only when a user invokes
 *     the action (though verification may later occur at other stages, such as when starting a component).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Verification is allowed to be run only when a Reporting Task is fully stopped. I.e., it has no active threads
 *     and currently has a state of STOPPED. Therefore, any initialization logic that may need to be performed
 *     before the Reporting Task is triggered may also be required for verification. However, the framework is not responsible
 *     for triggering the Lifecycle management stages, such as @OnScheduled before triggering the verification. Such
 *     methods should be handled by the {@link #verify(ConfigurationContext, ComponentLog)} itself.
 *     The {@link #verify(ConfigurationContext, ComponentLog)} method will only be called if the configuration is valid according to the
 *     validation rules (i.e., all Property Descriptors' validators and customValidate methods have indicated that the configuration is valid).
 * </p>
