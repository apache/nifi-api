 * <code>FlowRegistryClient</code>s are discovered using Java's

 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The implementation must implement this interface.</li>
 * <li>The implementation must have a file named
 * org.apache.nifi.registry.flow.FlowRegistryClient located within the jar's
 * <code>META-INF/services</code> directory. This file contains a list of
 * fully-qualified class names of all <code>FlowRegistryClient</code>s in the
 * jar, one-per-line.
 * <li>The implementation must support a default constructor.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>FlowRegistryClient</code> instances are always considered "active" and approachable when the validation status is considered as valid.
 * Therefore after initialize, implementations must expect incoming requests any time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The argument list of the request methods contain instances <code>FlowRegistryClientConfigurationContext</code>, which always contains the current
 * state of the properties. Caching properties between method calls is not recommended.
